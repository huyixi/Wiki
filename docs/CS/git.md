# Git

## Best Practice

### Type of commit

```bash
feat:     The new feature being added to a particular application
fix:      A bug fix (this correlates with PATCH in SemVer)
style:    Feature and updates related to styling
refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
test:     Everything related to testing
docs:     Everything related to documentation
chore:    Regular code maintenance
```

- Use Clear and Concise Commit Messages
  - A great commit message should be less than **10 words**. 

### Git Branch

Any code in the main branch should be deployable.
Create new descriptively-named branches off the main branch for new work, such as feature/add-new-payment-types.
Commit new work to your local branches and regularly push work to the remote.
To request feedback or help, or when you think your work is ready to merge into the main branch, open a pull request.
After your work or feature has been reviewed and approved, it can be merged into the main branch.
Once your work has been merged into the main branch, it should be deployed immediately.
